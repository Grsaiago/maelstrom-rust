# maelstrom-rust

This repository serves two main purposes

1. Store my sollutions for the [fly.io gossip gloomers challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/)
2. Implement a library for interacting with maelstrom in Rust, heavilly inspired
by the [Go implementation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/demo/go) of said library
